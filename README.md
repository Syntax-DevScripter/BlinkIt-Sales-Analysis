# BlinkIt-Sales-Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes Blinkit's sales data to uncover key insights about customer purchasing behavior, product performance, and sales trends. Using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, we perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand trends in sales, product categories, payment methods, and delivery performance.

## Key Objectives
- **Understand Sales Trends**: Analyze total sales over time and identify peak seasons.
- **Identify Best-Selling Products**: Determine the most popular product categories and top-selling items.
- **Analyze Customer Purchasing Behavior**: Determine the typical price range of most orders.
- **Assess Payment Preferences**: Determine the most commonly used payment methods (UPI, Cash, etc.).
- **Evaluate Delivery Performance**: Analyze delivery efficiency and delays.

## Methodologies
1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing**:
   - Load datasets from CSV files.
   - Convert date columns to proper datetime format.
   - Handle missing values by removing incomplete records.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Generate summary statistics for key numerical columns.
   - Visualize order total distribution using histograms.
   - Identify top-selling product categories using bar charts.
   - Analyze sales trends with time-series plots.

3. **Customer & Payment Analysis**:
   - Evaluate customer preferences for payment methods.
   - Identify trends in order values and repeat purchases.

4. **Delivery Performance Evaluation**:
   - Calculate delivery delays by comparing actual and promised delivery times.
   - Visualize the distribution of delivery delays using histograms.

## Conclusion
This analysis provides insights into sales patterns, customer behavior, and operational efficiency, helping Blinkit optimize their product offerings and improve customer satisfaction.
